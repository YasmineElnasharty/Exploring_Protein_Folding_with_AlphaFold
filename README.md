# Unraveling_Protein_Folding_with_AlphaFold

## Overview
This repository demonstrates the use of **AlphaFold**, a revolutionary AI-driven system by DeepMind, to predict the 3D structures of proteins based on their amino acid sequences. The project focuses on two proteins: **Chaperone protein YscY** and **Yop translocation protein**, and provides an in-depth exploration of their predicted structures.

## Project Objectives
- **Understand Protein Folding:** Investigate the importance of protein folding in biological systems.
- **Evaluate AlphaFold's Impact:** Assess AlphaFold's predictive methods and their implications for drug discovery, genomics, and precision medicine.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Protein sequences were sourced and pre-processed.
2. **Structure Prediction:** Employed ColabFold, a Google Colab implementation of AlphaFold, to predict the protein structures.
3. **Visualization:** Used ChimeraX to visualize the predicted structures, providing insights into their three-dimensional conformations.
4. **Analysis:** Analyzed the predicted structures for accuracy and biological relevance using metrics like pLDDT and Predicted Aligned Error.

## Key Tools & Technologies
- **AlphaFold:** For predicting protein structures from amino acid sequences.
- **ColabFold:** A Colab-based implementation of AlphaFold for accessible structure prediction.
- **ChimeraX:** For visualizing and analyzing predicted protein structures.
