# Unraveling_Protein_Folding_with_AlphaFold
A repository showcasing the application of AlphaFold in predicting protein structures, focusing on methodologies and results obtained from two protein sequences: Chaperone protein YscY and Yop translocation protein. Includes Python scripts for running AlphaFold with ColabFold, and visualizing protein structures using ChimeraX.
